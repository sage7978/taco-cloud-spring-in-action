Spring in action Taco Cloud 


This is a repo I am maintaining on the sole purpose of maximizing my learning experience of Spring through "Spring in action" Book (5th Edition)

Although there is already a repo present by github user "habuma". It was very helpful for me on this journey.

* There were many challenges I faced while coding; In a lot of cases, old codes were not working, I had to find correct versions of those codes; 
  It was really adventurous to dive deep into unknown and find solutions.
  
  For Example => Spring security; WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter was depreciated as of I speak now. So I found a great article to implement alternatives
